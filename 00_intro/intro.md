# Introduction

In almost all machine learning tasks, having a high quality corpus
to train on is essential.

This book aims to provide one possible method of natural language
corpus creation. There's not really a "right way" to do this that
works for all langauges or all corpora. Feel free to adjust, fix,
or eliminate anything that doesn't quite work for your domain and
problem space.

The general idea has several steps:

* Understand what data is available
  * Including its licensing
* Understand what format the data is in
  * Each provider will often have their own conventions
* Understand what format you want the data in
  * Your problem space will determine how you need to change the raw data

I'll go through each of these steps in sequence throughout this
book, and hopefully it'll give you a good framework for building
your own corpus creation system.
